Project Overview
In this project, I had implemented KNN(k-nearest neighbour) algoritm, alongside NCA(Neighbour Component Analysis), which is a form of dimensionality reduction. It had rendered better accuracy and had taken less time to fit the model, as compared to utilising solely the former. After training the model, it had given 83 percent on the training dataset, and 72 percent on the test set, respectively. It can take an audio file with .au extension as an input, and then classify it into one of the following genres: blues, metal, classical, country, hip-pop, disco, pop, metal,jazz, reggae, rock.
